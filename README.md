By pressing S you can enabled/disable the SIMD instruction set, compare the frame rate when SIMD is disabled to when it is enabled.
 
It is not always the case you will achieve double the frame rate, as in the example above, this will depend on what else is set to execute during the OnUserUpdate execution.

You can also press E to enable/disable Storing of Sub Sprites (this is explained in Section “A Little More Technical”), again compare the frame rate when SIMD is enabled, and Store Sub Sprites are Enabled / Disabled.
Store Sub Sprites Disabled
 
This demo showcases all the available SIMD options available, such as DrawPartailSprite_SIMD, getting Sprites from a Sprite Sheet, flip and resize options.

**Please see the attached help file for all options and how it works**:
